# scih - SCI-Hooks
This project is a simple glue-project that enables the use of http hooks like the ones found in GitHub, GitLab or Gitea
on a `sci` based build-server.

## Build
This project officially uses `uv`, but regular python tooling should work as well.
```sh

```

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e .
```
